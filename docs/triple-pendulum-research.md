# Cart-triple-pendulum research notes

Last updated: 2026-09-19 ~00:10 CT.


## Implementation status (2026-09-19)

**Built on `main`:** cart-triple plant parallel to the double, same UVFA+PPO recipe (not Lim 8× TQC).

| Piece | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Physics | `train/physics_triple.py` | Batched torch, 4×4 mass solve, θ=0 upright, no track walls |
| Constants | `shared/constants-triple.json` | 3 equal links; `obsDim=25` |
| Goals | `train/goals_triple.py` | **8 eqs:** DDD, DDU, DUD, DUU, UDD, UDU, UUD, UUU; `OBS_DIM=25` |
| Train | `train/train_triple.py` | Reuses PPO; align/energy/center/oob; HER optional; `--transition-only` available but **not** the default |
| Smoke | `train/test_physics_triple.py` | Inverted unstable, hang restoring, nowalls |
| Launch | `scripts/next-train-triple.sh` | **Normal multi-eq curriculum** (hang / near-goal / UUU bias / energy) like early double |
| Watcher | `scripts/continue-triple.sh` | Loop forever like `continue-xonly.sh` |

**OBS_DIM = 25** = 11 state (`x,ẋ,sin/cos×3,ω×3`) + one-hot(8) + target sin/cos(6).

**Curriculum default:** hang_start / near-goal / wrong-eq / soft UUU bias — reach and hold the 8 equilibria first. Do **not** default to `--transition-only` (that remains the double xonly experiment). Transition-only over 56 pairs is a later phase once local capture works.

**L4 launch status:** Plant synced to `cartpole-train-od` for import/physics smoke only. **Do not** start triple GPU trains until the overnight gate / parent says go — leave double xonly alone.

**Launch (cold):**
```bash
NUM_ENVS=8192 bash scripts/next-train-triple.sh
# A/B tip: HANG_START_P=0.55 LR=1e-3 RUN_NAME=... CHECKPOINT=policies/checkpoint-triple-b.pt OUT=policies/policy-triple-b.json
```

Double **xonly** on GCP stays untouched.


## What "56" means

Not 56 equilibria. A planar cart-**triple**-pendulum has **8** discrete equilibria: each of 3 links is Up or Down → \(2^3 = 8\) (DDD … UUU). Directed transitions between distinct eqs: \(8 \times 7 =\) **56**. (Our double plant is the same idea: \(2^2 = 4\) eqs, \(4 \times 3 = 12\) directed transitions.)

Representation (same UVFA style as our double):
- State: cart \(x,\dot x\) + \((\sin\theta_i,\cos\theta_i,\dot\theta_i)\) for \(i=1,2,3\)
- Goal: one-hot(8) + target sin/cos for three angles (or 3-bit EP index)

## Classical control vs RL

| Approach | What it does | 56 transitions? |
|---|---|---|
| Glück et al. Automatica 2013 | Nonlinear feedforward (BVP) + time-varying Riccati; **experimental DDD→UUU** swing-up | Method applies in principle to other EPs; **not** all 56 demonstrated |
| Graichen et al. CDC 2005 | Constrained feedforward + LQR side-stepping of upright triple | Side-step / hold, not the full 56 graph |
| Lim / Ju / Lee KIEE 2025 | Sim-to-real **TQC**; custom high-fidelity plant; **all 56 on hardware** | Yes (reported + YouTube) |
| fawraw/triple-pendulum-sim2real | MuJoCo + TQC; aiming at 56 without feedforward | M4 still in progress (hand-off basin); as of 2026-06 not done |
| MDPI Machines 2025 (same lab lineage) | Double inverted pendulum Sim2Real; **4 EPs / 12 transitions** | Double cousin of our problem |

**Bottom line:** Classical feedforward covers swing-up / side-step with models. Getting *all* 56 without precomputed trajectories is the RL/sim2real benchmark — and Lim et al. already published a hardware demo (2025). PPO/TQC/SAC are viable; our transition-only PPO UVFA is one shape; Lim used a different one (below).

| Choice | Lim et al. | Our double stack |
|---|---|---|
| Algo | **TQC** (3 critics, 25 atoms; policy 400→300; lr 3e-4) | PPO |
| Goal encoding | **8 separate policies** (one per EP); retarget by swapping the agent | Single UVFA + one-hot / goal sincos |
| Transition curriculum | **None explicit** — randomize start state over wide ranges; each policy attracts to its EP → transitions emerge | `--transition-only` samples A→B≠A every ep |
| Reward | **Product** of [0,1] terms: \(R_u R_y R_{\theta1} R_{\theta2} R_{\theta3} R_{\dot\theta1}\ldots\) with **cumulative absolute angles** \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_1+\theta_2\), \(\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3\) vs targets | Dense align / at_goal style |
| Reality gap | Domain randomization of ICs + purpose-built hardware (dual-rail, hollow-shaft joints, degreased bearings, direct-drive BLDC) | Sim-only for now |
| Action | Cart **acceleration** \(u\) (with \(\|u\|\) penalty) | Cart force (1D) |

Implication: "all 56" does **not** require training 56 specialists. Eight attractors + diverse starts can cover the graph. Our UVFA + transition-only is still a valid (and more parameter-efficient) alternative; Lim is evidence the plant is solvable with off-policy continuous control.

## Can we "append" the double policy?

Action stays 1D (cart force) — good. Observation and goal encodings **must grow**:
- Double obs_dim 16 → triple roughly +3 (sin/cos/ω for link 3) + expand one-hot 4→8 and goal sincos +2 → new obs_dim ~22–24.

Naïve "pad and continue" does **not** just work: weights for θ3 / new goal bits are undefined; dynamics change (coupling). Options:

1. **Input/output adapters** — freeze double hidden layers; new linear map; expand goal head; fine-tune with PPO (PPOPT-style).
2. **Progressive nets** — freeze double column; new column for triple with lateral adapters (Rusu et al. 2016). Keeps double policy intact.
3. **Fresh policy + curriculum** — train triple from scratch (Lim-style 8× TQC, or our UVFA PPO); use double only as teacher / reward shaping for the first two links.
4. **Lim-style 8 specialists** — skip UVFA entirely; train one TQC/PPO per EP with randomized starts.

**Clear answer on transfer:** No free append. Lim trained fresh. Adapters/PNN can reuse base-link swing instincts; third link + full graph still need substantial new learning. Prefer (3) or (4) as default; treat (1)/(2) as an A/B experiment once a plant exists.

## Implication for our stack

- Keep double **xonly** grinding 12 directed transitions on the shared L4; share headroom with triple multi-eq jobs (do not kill xonly).
- Triple plant is live (see Implementation status). Default recipe: **normal multi-eq PPO** (hang/near-goal/UUU bias) to reach/hold 8 eqs — same path as early double, **not** transition-only first.
- Later: optional `--transition-only` over 56 pairs, or Lim-style 8× TQC as A/B — not the overnight default.
- Optional: adapter/progressive init from double ckpt as a side experiment, not a requirement.
